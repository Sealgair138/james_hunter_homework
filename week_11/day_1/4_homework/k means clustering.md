K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data together using distance. it can be used in 2 and 3 dimensional data.
It works by Grouping similar data together. The "K" in the name represents the number of clusters you want to have. for every point on the plot it calculates the mean of its x and y coordinates.
now if you have the x and y mean for every data point, in every cluster. you can work out the centroid for each cluster using the x and y means.
This allows you to best fit the centroid to the data points based on the distance from data points are from the centroids, allowing for more accurate clusters

Clustering is used almost everywhere in most fields, Being able to break things and even people into groups based on similarities.
Such as where people are spending there money, and what they are buying. Clustering is also heavily used in search engines, when you ask google something
the engine has to cluster all the information together.
